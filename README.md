# attsw-exercise

The goal of this exercise is to implement a simple multi-module project based on employees stored in a database, in a TDD way.

You should learn also how to cooperate on a project using Github and its PR mechanism.

When working on a single task, all the other dependencies must be mocked; if (abstract) dependencies are not yet present you must implement them in that task. Make sure that your SUT refers to dependencies via interfaces, and that the actual implementation will be provided by "someone else", e.g., via a constructor.

Merge conflicts are expected, so don't be scared of them: you must learn how to deal with them.

The goal is also to implement single small components that are independent from the actual implementation of dependencies and that must be tested with unit tests.

Be also prepared to refactor what you implement in a task, according to PR that are merged in the meantime.
